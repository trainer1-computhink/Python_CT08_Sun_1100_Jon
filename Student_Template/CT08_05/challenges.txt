School Attendance System — Graded Challenge Tasks
=================================================

Task 1 (Foundation — Input Validation & Control Flow)
Goal: Make the program robust and exam-safe.
Requirements:
- Menu choice must NOT crash if user enters letters or symbols.
- Attendance input must only accept y / n (case-insensitive).
- Attendance threshold must be between 0 and 100.
Done when:
- Program keeps running correctly even with invalid input.

Focus skills: while loop, boolean logic, input validation.


Task 2 (Foundation — Attendance Calculation Logic)
Goal: Strengthen loop-based computation.
Requirements:
- Rewrite attendance_percentage() WITHOUT using count().
- Use a loop and accumulator variable only.
- Display:
  student name
  present lessons
  total lessons
  percentage (2 decimal places)
Done when:
- Student understands how percentages are derived step-by-step.

Focus skills: for loop, accumulator pattern, arithmetic.


Task 3 (Intermediate — Class Statistics)
Goal: Work with nested loops and aggregate data.
Requirements:
- Add a menu option: “View Class Statistics”
- Display:
  - Class average attendance %
  - Highest attendance student(s)
  - Lowest attendance student(s)
Rules:
- Do NOT hardcode values.
- Must reuse attendance_percentage().
Done when:
- Output adapts correctly as attendance data changes.

Focus skills: nested loops, min/max logic, list handling.


Task 4 (Intermediate — Student Management)
Goal: Modify dictionary data safely.
Requirements:
- Add menu options:
  - Add new student
  - Remove existing student
- Names must be case-insensitive.
- Prevent duplicate student names.
Done when:
- Student list can be edited without breaking the system.

Focus skills: dictionaries, key checks, defensive programming.

Task 5 (Advanced — Consecutive Absence Detection)
Goal: Detect patterns, not just totals.
Requirements:
- Add function: detect_consecutive_absences(student, N)
- Flag student if absent N times in a row.
- Add menu option to list flagged students.
Rules:
- Use loops only (no slicing shortcuts).
Done when:
- System detects patterns like: False, False, False.

Focus skills: state tracking, loop logic, condition sequencing.


Task 6 (Advanced — File Saving & Loading)
Goal: Introduce real-world persistence.
Requirements:
- Save attendance_dict to a JSON file.
- Load attendance_dict from the file.
- Add menu options: Save / Load.
Rules:
- Data must persist after restarting the program.
Done when:
- Program continues from last saved state.

Focus skills: file I/O, dictionaries, real-world application.


(Optional Extension — For Fast Finishers)
Goal: Stretch thinking beyond syllabus.
Choose ONE:
A) Add “Late” attendance and decide how it affects percentage.
B) Export a CSV attendance report.
C) Refactor repeated input validation into reusable functions.

Optional stretch — not required for all students.
