# Lesson 3 - Restaurant Menu

## Task 1: Display the Menu
**Display the Menu**

Write a program that:​
- Creates a dictionary with at least 5 menu items and their prices.​
- Prints all the items in the menu with their prices, one item per line.

## Task 2: Check if item exists
**Take the Customer’s Order and Check if it Exists**

Asks the customer for the item they want to order.​

Checks if the item exists in the menu.​
- If it exists: Print the item and its price.​
- If it does not exist: Display a message saying the item is unavailable.​

Keep asking again and again until customer says “no more”

## Task 3: Add ordered item to another Dictionary
**Add the Ordered Item to Another Dictionary**

Extend your program so that it:​
- If the item exists, asks the customer if they want to add it to their order.​
If the customer says "yes," ​
add the item and its price to a separate dictionary that stores the customer’s order.​
If the customer says "no," ​
display a message confirming the item was not added.

## Task 4: Display Order Summary and Total Cost
**Display the Order Summary and Total Cost**

After the customer finishes ordering:​
- Display all the items in their order with the prices.​
- Calculate and display the total cost of the order.

## Challenge 1: Wallet Feature
Assign a wallet balance to the customer (e.g., $10).​

Before confirming an order, check if the total cost will exceed the customer’s wallet balance.​
- If the total exceeds the wallet balance, display a message and do not add the item.​
- If the total is within the wallet balance, confirm the order as usual and reduce the balance.
