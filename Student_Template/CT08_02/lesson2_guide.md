# Lesson 2 - Bubble Sort Algorithm

## Task 1: Ascending Number
Write a program to determine if the following number sequence is in ascending order. ​

Ascending is from smallest to biggest​

- 1, 3, 4, 8, 14, 17, 32, 41, 44, 45​
- 6, 13, 15, 17, 18, 34, 41, 40, 44, 46​
- 18, 22, 23, 26, 27, 34, 36, 37, 44, 47​
- 3, 7, 8, 16, 45, 31, 20, 22, 14, 23

## Task 2: Bubble Sort
Using the bubble sort algorithm, sort the following numbers in ascending order.​

- 9, 6, 3, 25, 21, 8, 23, 1, 17, 14​
- 37, 39, 41, 29, 9, 25, 43, 21, 3, 42
- 24, 8, 10, 22, 45, 34, 28, 39, 3, 32​
- 15, 21, 8, 32, 46, 44, 37, 20, 27, 22​
- 11, 38, 4, 28, 24, 41, 15, 10, 45, 14
