Quiz Grading System — Advanced Challenge Questions
(For Fastest Students | No File I/O)
=================================================

Task 1 — Uneven Answer Lists (Defensive Programming)
Some students did not answer all questions.
Modify grade_all_students() so that:
- If a student has fewer answers than the answer key, missing answers are treated as wrong.
- If a student has more answers than the answer key, extra answers are ignored.
- The program must NOT crash.
Done when:
- All students are graded correctly even with uneven answer lists.


Task 2 — Question Weighting (Parallel Lists)
Each question carries different marks.
Example:
answer_key = ["A", "B", "B", "D"]
question_marks = [2, 1, 3, 4]

Modify grade_all_students() so that:
- A correct answer adds the corresponding marks.
- An incorrect or missing answer adds 0.
- Total score is based on marks, not number of correct answers.
Done when:
- Scores change correctly if question marks are modified.


Task 3 — Percentage + Grade Assignment
Convert each student’s score into:
- Total score
- Percentage score
- Letter grade

Grade boundaries:
- ≥ 75% → A
- ≥ 60% → B
- ≥ 50% → C
- else → D

Rules:
- Total possible marks must be calculated dynamically.
- Output example:
  john : 6/8 (75%) Grade: A
Done when:
- Grade changes correctly when marks or answer key length change.


Task 4 — Class Performance Analysis
Add a menu option: “Class Performance Summary”.
Display:
- Class average score (percentage)
- Number of students above average
- Number of students below average
- Number of students who scored full marks
Rules:
- Must reuse existing functions where possible.
- No hardcoded values.
Done when:
- Summary adapts automatically as data changes.


Task 5 — Hardest Question Detection (Nested Loops)
Identify the hardest question in the quiz.
Definition:
- The question with the highest number of wrong answers.

Output example:
Hardest Question: Q2 (3 students got it wrong)

Rules:
- If there is a tie, list all hardest questions.
- Question numbering starts from 1.
Done when:
- Output updates correctly if student answers change.


Task 6 — Consistency Check (Pattern Detection)
Detect students with inconsistent performance.
Definition:
- Student answered at least 80% of the first half correctly
- Student answered 0% of the second half correctly

Output example:
Inconsistent performance detected: alice

Rules:
- Must work for both even and odd number of questions.
- Use loops and conditions only.
Done when:
- Program flags students based on pattern, not hardcoded positions.


Task 7 — Smart Ranking System
Rank students by score.
Rules:
- Highest score → Rank 1
- Students with the same score share the same rank
- Next rank is skipped accordingly
Example:
Scores: [10, 10, 8, 6]
Ranks:  [1, 1, 3, 4]

Output example:
1. jane (10)
1. bob (10)
3. john (8)
4. alice (6)

Done when:
- Ranking updates correctly if scores change.
